DIGITAL CITIZEN CONTRIBUTOR KATHERINE MAHER [1] SHARES A FEW WORDS
ABOUT IMPRISONED EGYPTIAN BLOGGER ALAA ABD EL FATTAH.

Leading Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah is behind bars once
again. Convicted of violating Egypt’s protest law and attacking a
police officer, the 31-year-old was sentenced in absentia to 15 years
[2] in prison, along with 24 other activists, all found guilty of
threatening public order. 

Reporting on the case,Reuters called [3] Alaa an “anti-Mubarak
activist.” This was true, but incomplete. Alaa is an activist for
social justice, dignity, and human rights; anti-Mubarak, but also
anti-SCAF, anti-Morsi, and anti-Sisi. His is a voice for freedom and
against abuses of power. 

He is also a friend and an ally to many members of the Digital Citizen
team and broader regional community. 

Alaa Abd El Fattah has been jailed or investigated under every
Egyptian head of state who has served during his lifetime. In 2006, he
was arrested [4] for taking part in a peaceful protest. In 2011, he
spent two months in prison [5], missing his first child’s birth. In
2013, he was arrested [6] and detained for 115 days without trial.
Less than three months after his last release, Alaa is now facing 15
years in prison. 

Alaa openly acknowledged the toll this would take on his life. In a
letter to his family during his most recent detention,he wrote [7]:
_“It is not only impossible to live life fully under oppression, it
is also dangerous and futile to pretend one can. I can only live here
as a prisoner.”_ 

The sentences borne by Alaa and the 24 others are the longest yet in
astring of crackdowns [8] on freedom of expression, assembly, and
opinion. The protest law [9] has been used to jail other prominent
activists, including outspoken human rights lawyer Mahienour El-Massry
[10], and April 6 movement [11] founder Ahmed Maher. This month, three
_Al Jazeera_ journalists were sentenced [12] to seven and ten years in
prison for “reporting false news." As we edited this edition, it was
reported [13] that Alaa's 20-year-old sister, Sanaa Seif, is facing
charges along with human rights lawyer Yara Sallam [14]. 

This unjust sentence deprives Alaa of his freedom. It denies his son
Khaled his father, his wife Manal her husband. Along with those handed
to dozens of other peaceful protesters, lawyers, and journalists, this
sentence deprives Egypt of the justice and freedom it so greatly
deserves. 

At the Digital Citizen, we stand for human rights and freedom. We
stand with Alaa and with the many Egyptians unjustly detained under
this and other regimes. We call for an end to police brutality,
judicial impunity, and the abuse of executive power.Join us [15].
#FreeAlaa. 

EGYPT

As reported last month [16], the Egyptian Ministry of Interior plans
to formalize social media surveillance in Egypt. Writing for the
Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, Ramy Raoof takes on
questions [17] and debunks myths about the proposal. “Monitoring
should take place over a limited period of time and focus on a
specific set of issues or individuals posing a legitimate threat to
safety,” he writes. Digital security expert and advocate Amr
Gharbeia called the proposal “Orwellian,” [18] stating that it
would further empower the already-authoritarian state while Privacy
International said the proposal [19] would “[turn] social media in
Egypt into an intelligence resource for the authorities.” 

On June 17, a coalition of human rights groups and individuals filed a
lawsuit [20] in the Administrative Court to put a stop to [21] [ar]
the Ministry of Interior’s tender [22] to procure software for
social media monitoring. 

The surveillance proposal is merely one piece of a broader crackdown.
Three journalists with Al Jazeera English were sentenced to 15 years
in jail [23] on charges of making a “devilish pact” with the
ousted Muslim Brotherhood. Prosecutors charged Mohamed Fahmy, Peter
Greste and Baher Mohammed of smearing Egypt’s reputation, aiding the
Brotherhood, and falsifying footage. Another Al Jazeera journalist,
Abdullah al-Shamy, was released June 17 after being imprisoned since
August 2013. 

IRAQ

Amid a security crisis [24], the embattled Iraqi government blocked
Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. A a leaked document from the Iraqi
Ministry of Telecommunications revealed that ISPs were ordered to shut
down [25] the Internet in five provinces and to block the leading
social media platforms countrywide, all in an attempt to stop ISIS
militants from using social media to spread propaganda. 

Jillian York told the BBC [26]: “The Iraqi government will not
achieve anything by blocking social media websites...in doing so,
they're cutting off a lifeline for activists and others to the outside
world.” the embattled Iraqi government blocked Facebook, Twitter,
and YouTube. 

Citizen Lab released a report [27] documenting how the Internet is
being controlled amidst the ISIS insurgency. 

PALESTINE 

In response to the alleged kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers, a
Facebook page [28] emerged entitled “Until our boys are returned -
we will kill a terrorist every hour.” The page, which is in Hebrew
and displays photographs of specific individuals calling for their
execution, has sparked outrage [29] from many who believe that
Facebook gives preferential treatment to users from Israel, in
contrast to those from Palestine. In 2011, the company took down a
page [30] calling for a third _intifada _(uprising) after Israeli
officials complained that it incited violence against Jewish people. 

Facebook’s Community Standards [31] state: “We remove content and
may escalate to law enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of
physical harm, or a direct threat to public safety. You may not
credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-world
violence…” Facebook has not commented publicly on whether the page
violates their standards. 

KUWAIT

Kuwait plans [32] to pass laws aimed at regulating the use of social
media and giving authorities the power to block websites, monitor
phone calls, and terminate phone lines for “security reasons.” A
single tweet [33] violating the law could send a Twitter user to jail
for a year. Authorities claim these new measures will be used to
combat cases of alleged blasphemy and sectarianism as well as ensure
national security. 

Kuwait’s Supreme Court sentenced online activist Hejab Al Hajeri to
two years in jail for writing tweets that were allegedly offensive to
the country’s Emir, Sheikh Sabah al Ahmad Al Sabah. The verdict came
amid unrest in the region, prompting the Kuwaiti government to tighten
its grip on freedom of expression. Al Hajeri is not alone however;
there have been reports of several other cases such as the woman who
was sentenced to11 years in prison [34] for remarks she made on
Twitter. Al Hajeriwrote [35] on this Twitter account after the ruling
that his “determination is bigger than their jail.” 

LIBYA

The climate is getting more dangerous for media workers in Libya. This
month an editor and a journalist were killed within three days of each
other. Muftah Buseid [36], editor of the state-owned newspaper Burniq
and a vocal critic of extremist groups, was gunned down shortly after
receiving a death threat. Three days after the shooting, Naseeb Miloud
Karfana [37], a TV journalist with the state-run Libya Al-Wataniya,
was found dead along with her fiancé. 

MOROCCO

Ali Anouzla, the_ Lakome_ editor facing terrorism charges [38] for
linking to a blog post that linked to a video posted by Al Qaeda in
the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), “continues to be targeted by the justice
system seven months after his conditional release,” writes Reporters
Without Borders [39]. Anouzla was scheduled to appear in front of a
judge in late May, but his hearing was postponed indefinitely,
reportedly because the scheduled judge was on vacation. _Lakome_’s
English and Arabic editions both remain blocked in the country. 

Reports [40] that authorities are targeting members of the February 20
movement—that emerged in 2011 amidst the regional uprisings—abound
[41]. Movement leaders used digital media to gain widespread attention
in 2011, but faltered amid crackdowns. 

El Haqed (aka I7a9ed), a rapper and icon of the movement, was arrested
on May 18 and remains in detention. Visit the campaign [42] site for
his release. 

OMAN

Working from information leaked by Edward Snowden, the Register
revealed [43] the existence of a spy hub located on the northern coast
of Oman and operated by Britain's Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ). 

GCHQ has three spy bases located in Oman, “where it taps into
various undersea cables passing through the Strait of Hormuz into the
Persian/Arabian Gulf,” the Register’s Duncan Campbell reported on
June 3. These “above-top-secret” details were not known to the
public until recently, due to government pressure on media
organizations reporting on the Snowden files, the Register said. 

SAUDI ARABIA

Lawyer and fundamental rights defender Waleed Abu Al-Khair was charged
on May 28 under the Anti-Cyber Crime Law for allegedly preparing,
storing and sending information that prejudices public order and
sentenced [44] to 15 years in prison [44]. 

A report [45] from the Committee to Protect Journalist claims that
Saudi Arabia’s censorship “blurs lines between journalism [and]
activism.” The Ministry of Culture has blocked local news websites
[46] that refuse to register and new anti-terrorism regulations [47]
threaten to restrict criticism of the government or Islam. 

A new report [48] from the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab looks
at the use of Hacking Team’s Remote Control System (RCS) by the
government of Saudi Arabia as part of a broader campaign of
information control. 

SYRIA

The US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
fined the Dubai-based arm of Aramex [49] USD $125,000 for the
unlicensed export to Syria of Internet monitoring devices and
software. According to BIS, which controls the export and of US
commodities, technology and software relating to national security,
the Aramex fine relates to a USD $2.8 million penalty imposed last
year on Dubai-based Computerlinks FZCO for similar activity. BIS said
Computerlinks knew the order it placed with Blue Coat Systems was
destined for end users in Syria but claimed it was for Iraq's Ministry
of Telecom and the Afghan Internet service provider, Liwalnet. 

TUNISIA

Speaking to the local web magazine Webdo, Jamel Zenkri, head of the
newly-established Technical Telecommunications Agency (ATT), said [50]
that ATT will start operating at full capacity between late July and
early August. Zenkri added that the ATT currently has surveillance
technologies at its disposal but declined to reveal where the agency
obtained such equipment. 

The ATT will start by monitoring the Internet, while the Interior
Ministry is set to carry out phone-tapping practices. “Under the
decree, phone surveillance lies in the ATT’s field of
intervention,” Zenkri said. He explained that  they could not carry
out the decree in full until next year, due to “equipment
problems”. 

ATT’s creation by government decree in November 2013 raised human
rights concerns among activists due to vague language and lack of
independent oversight mechanisms in the law. 

ALGERIA

Ould Dada wassentenced [51] [fr] to two years in prison for allegedly
posting videos that show Algerian police officers stealing from a
local shop in the region of Ghardai. Dada was accused of [52]
disseminating pictures and videos detrimental to the national
interest. The videos come from a larger network of shared content on
incidents of sectarian violence that played out nearby. Algerian
activists released a number of videos exposing [51] police brutality
during the incidents. The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information
demanded that authorities release the journalist saying that,
“Instead of punishing the citizen- who exercised his natural right
of filing and publishing the violations- the state should rather
punish the policemen involved in the theft.” 

JORDAN

Jordan’s parliament will soon discuss a series of draft amendments
[53] to the country’s Telecommunication Law. Under the proposed
amendments, Internet Service Providers would be required to block
adult content while the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission would
be in charge of issuing filtering orders. 

“Centralizing online filtering could endow the government with a
sort of “moral custodianship” over Jordanian Internet users,
telling them what content they should or should not access,” said
Reem Almasri, research director for the Amman-based media
organization, 7iber, which declined to seek a license for their
website under the new law. The 7iber site has been blocked twice in
Jordan [54] since last year. 

These newly-proposed restrictions come a year after the blocking of
300 websites by the Jordanian authorities under a series of amendments
to the Press and Publication Law that require news websites to
register with the authorities and hold editors liable for readers’
comments. 

CPJ’s Sherif Mansour wrote [55]: “Jordan’s press freedom
climate, once a shining light in the Middle East, has quickly
deteriorated as journalists grapple with last year's governmentban
[56] on nearly 300 news websites.” 

BAHRAIN

The Bahraini crackdown on Internet users seems to be having its ups
and downs. While one man wasreleased [57] from police custody after
being incarcerated for allegedly insulting and slandering people, as
well as attacking the honor and reputation of Bahraini families on
social media, another man has beenimprisoned [58] for the same acts.
The second man was arrested for inciting hatred towards Bahrain’s
leadership and was accused of posting sectarian-tainted tweets,
despite his claim that he does not have a Twitter account. He will
face trial at the nation’s criminal court. 

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoumlaunched [59] the Arab Social
Media Award, which will showcase important social media initiatives in
the Arab world and promote “best practices” platforms and
technologies at a ceremony to be held annually in Dubai. “[By]
honoring online influencers, we stress the great value that an
innovative and effective social media presence can bring,” said
Sheikh Mohammad. The Award will honor individuals or organizations
from government entities, the private sector, blogs, media, sports,
tolerance, social service, education, youth, technology, economy,
politics for their ability to communicate effectively and creativity,
and for their overall impact on society. 

QATAR

At the recent Al Jazeera Forum held in Doha, Qatar, one panel managed
to make headlines [60] for its bold take on free speech. The panel
featured young Arab comedians who use YouTube to push boundaries and
tackle topics that news channels in their countries treat as taboo. 

SUDAN

Commenting on sanctions that prevent access to vital technologies in
Sudan, the Electronic Frontier Foundation says [61] “...The
Department of Treasury is unjustly preventing Sudanese from accessing
information and technologies that are necessary for the advancement,
innovation, and democracy of the country.” The organization is
calling on the US government and US companies to take action to ease
the sanctions. 

A new online news platform in Sudan, _Al-Tareeq_, is making headlines
[62] in a country that Reporters Without Borders ranks as one of the
world’s 10 worst countries for press intimidation. The platform’s
journalists use encrypted communications and rely on a web server in
Sweden to protect their site from attacks.

 	* The MIT Enterprise Startup Competition [63] brought thirty Arab
entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley in early June to meet with industry
experts.
 	* A meeting of Gulf Cooperation Council leaders resulted in an
agreement [64] [ar] among ministers for more cooperation in policing
